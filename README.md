## Background

The goal of this project is to contribute data-driven evidence to the local school board of a district and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding the future school budget. Access to district-wide standardized test results and school information should aid in our quest to showcase obvious trends in school performance. 

## Methods

District Summary, which consists of total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), and % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading) was analyzed to view the district's key metrics. 

School Summary, which consists of school name, school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), and % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading) was analyzed to view key metrics about each school. 

Determining Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type can help draw relevant conclusions  or comparisons that can then be reported the the board.
