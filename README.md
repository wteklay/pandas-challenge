## Background

This project aims to contribute data-driven evidence to the local school board of a district and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding the future school budget. Access to district-wide standardized test results and school information should aid in our quest to showcase evident trends in school performance. 

## Methods

* District Summary, which consists of the total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), and % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading) was analyzed to view the district's key metrics. 

* School Summary, which consists of school name, school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math), % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading), and % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading) was analyzed to view critical metrics about each school. 

* Determining Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing), Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type can help draw relevant conclusions or comparisons that can then be reported the board. 

## Summary and conclusions 

- The total budget for the school district, which contains 15 schools, is $82,932,329,558.0 and enlists a total of 39,170. The average math score, the average reading score, and the percentage of the overall passing rate are 78.96, 81.88, and 80.43% respectively. 

- Wilson High School has the highest overall passing rate, while Rodriguez High School has the lowest overall passing rate, even though Wilson High school received a larger budget than Rodriguez High School. 

- Smaller schools with a total body of students of less than 1000 have a higher passing rate than large and medium-sized schools. 

- Lastly, Charter schools have a much higher overall passing rate than district or public schools. 

- The school might be more inclined to adopt Charter school curriculums and lessen the number of students per school.
